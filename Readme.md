## This is 2nd assignment for INFO 449: Mobile Development: IOS

Date: Spring 2017

### Requirements:

Project Name: CalcArrayPoints

Repository Name: calc-array-points

Submission URL: https://github.com/<your-github-username>/calc-array-points (Links to an external site.) (Links to an external site.)

Unit Tests:

This is not required, but if your code passes all the unit tests you are guaranteed 5/5 (besides a visual inspection of array fun's multiply, average, and count to ensure you made these generic). Also, it is useful to have experience with unit tests as we will be using them in future assignments.

Description:

Build a calculator

- create four functions for add, subtract, multiply, divide

each does the expected thing

- create a function that expects one of them along with two Ints

in other words, a generic "math operation" function
it should then take the two Ints and pass them to the function
and return the result
Array fun

- create two new functions for add/mul

instead of taking two Ints, take an array of Ints instead
return the result of (adding/multiplying) all of the elements
- create two new functions (count, avg) that take an array of Ints

again, operate on the array and return the result
return the result
- refactor all four down to another "generic math operation" approach

like in the previous part

Points

- use tuples to represent x/y point pairs

- create two functions for adding and subtracting points

(1,2) + (3,4) = (4,6)
(1,2) - (3,4) = (-2,-2)

- now use Dictionaries to represent points

"x" is the x coordinate, "y" is the y coordinate

- create two functions for adding and subtracting points

(1,2) + (3,4) = (4,6)
(1,2) - (3,4) = (-2,-2)
- handle dictionaries without "x" or "y" without crashing

- handle dictionaries with Double values without crashing
